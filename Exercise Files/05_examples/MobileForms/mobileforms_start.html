<h1>Using HTML5 Web Forms on Mobile Devices</h1>
<p>Some mobile device browsers provide support for HTML5 forms attributes and input types in order 
to allow the user to more easily enter certain kinds of data. Phones that use virtual, on-screen keyboards 
can provide customized versions of those keyboards that are optimized for those data types, such as email addresses, 
URLs, numbers, telephone numbers, and search queries.</p>
<p>This example file contains form fields for number, email, URL, tel, and search types, along with some of the new 
HTML5 form attributes.</p>
<form action="" method="get">
<p><input type="submit" value="submit" /></p>
</form>
